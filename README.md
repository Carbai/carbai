### Hi and welcome 👋

## I am still working on this page so if by chance you ended up here sorry I am doing my best :) 

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Carbai/carbai_public/blob/master/clus.gif" width="400">  I am a computational chemist 👩🏻‍💻.

Most of my time is dedicated to the understanding of the chemisty at the solid interface.

In this sense I use quantum-chemical (QM) and since more recently also molecular dynamics (MD) tools for the simulation of organics adsorption on icy structures representatives of interstellar ices.
In the past I worked in the simulation of material for energy storage and conversion.

If beer is the science you value the most follow us at Pint of Science <a href="https://pintofscience.it/"> <img src="https://github.com/Carbai/carbai_public/blob/master/Loghi/pos_Italy.png" width="40"> </a>

Github is the space I dedicated to a few scripts that I wrote during my compchem journey plus other coding I have been mostly doing for fun. 
I am learning a bit of JavaScript.
My main goal now is to become proficient with ML algorithms and their application for material discovery so in the next future we might find a little more about that.
