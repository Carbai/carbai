### Hi and welcome 👋

## I am still working on this page so if by chance you ended up here sorry I am doing my best :) 

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Carbai/carbai_public/blob/master/clus.gif" width="400">  I am a computational chemist 👩🏻‍💻.

Most of my time is dedicated to the understanding of the chemisty at the solid interface.

In this sense I use quantum-chemical (QM) and since more recently also molecular dynamics (MD) tools for the simulation of organics adsorption on icy structures representatives of interstellar ices.
In the past I worked in the simulation of material for energy storage and conversion.

Here you can find a few scripts that I wrote during my compchem journey plus other coding I have been mostly doing for fun. 
I am learning a bit of JavaScript.
My main goal now is to become proficient with ML algorith and their application for material discovery so in the next future we may be find a little more about this too.

- 🔭 I’m currently at the very end of my PhD (few months left)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML with Python
- 👯 I’m looking for a new job/career in science
- 💬 Ask me about anything you think I could have an answer for
