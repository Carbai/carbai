### Hi and welcome 👋

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Carbai/carbai_public/blob/master/clus.gif" width="400">  I am a computational chemist and data scientist 👩🏻‍💻.

During my PhD, I explored the chemisty at the solid interface.

By using quantum-chemical (QM) and molecular dynamics (MD) tools I had a priviledged view in the adsorption process of organics on icy structures.
Looking at how molecules interact and form, how cool is that?!

In the past I worked in the simulation of materials for energy storage and conversion.
I love catalysts, they have the power to make possible the impossible. It's up to us to find new and innovative chemical formula for more sustainable processes.

Github is the space I dedicate to a few scripts that I wrote during my compchem journey plus other coding I have been mostly doing for fun. 

I am currently learning a bit of JavaScript. My main goal now is to become proficient with ML algorithms and their application for material discovery so in the next future you might find a little more about that.
